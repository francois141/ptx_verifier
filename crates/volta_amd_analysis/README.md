# volta_amd_analysis

Experimental AMD kernel analysis for Volta.

`frontend::parse::parse_kernel(source, name)` parses Clang assembly;
`lower_kernel(&kernel)` validates the supported gfx950 instruction forms and
produces an AMD `LoweredKernel`. The lowering API and IR types are exported
from the crate root.

The IR represents AMD instructions for symbolic execution. It preserves
physical register identities, explicit waits, and launch metadata. The evaluator
initializes registers from the descriptor and launch inputs, tracks symbolic
register values, and executes scalar instructions once per wave and vector instructions
for individual lanes. Scalar loads read a concrete kernel argument buffer and keep their
destinations unavailable until `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)`. Scalar execution requires XNACK
to be disabled; other wait forms and reads outside the argument buffer are rejected.
Launch initialization supports full waves in 1D, 2D, and 3D workgroups, matching
[AMD's X/Y/Z launch interface](https://releases.llvm.org/21.1.0/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#initial-kernel-execution-state),
with an optional kernarg pointer and enabled workgroup IDs. Work-items are ordered
with X advancing first, then Y, then Z, following
[AMD's execution model](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/understand/programming_model.html#hierarchical-thread-model).
Unsupported instructions and launch layouts return `EvalError`.

Supported operand forms follow the [CDNA4 ISA](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/instruction-set-architectures/amd-instinct-cdna4-instruction-set-architecture.pdf)
(§6.2, §12.6, §12.7); scalar addressing and completion follow §8.2–8.3. Operand checks
also follow LLVM 21.1.8's
[operand validation](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-21.1.8/llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/AsmParser/AMDGPUAsmParser.cpp)
and [counter widths](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-21.1.8/llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/Utils/AMDGPUBaseInfo.cpp).

Target strings may include `xnack` and `sramecc` selections once each, in either
order. Unknown, repeated, conflicting or empty feature fields are rejected.
This validates the target string, not execution support for every feature mode.

## Tests

Unit tests cover instruction lowering and execution, launch-register placement,
work-item coordinate packing, and scalar load dependencies. Launch and scalar-load
tests also use a compiled fixture after parsing and lowering. Run the unit tests:

```sh
cargo test -p volta_amd_analysis --lib
```

### Regenerating the copy fixture

`tests/fixtures/copy.cl` is `out[i] = in[i]`, one element per workitem, and
`copy.s` is the assembly Homebrew clang 21.1.8 produced for it for gfx950
(MI355X). Apple's clang lacks the AMDGPU target; use LLVM's clang (Homebrew
`llvm@21` on macOS). Regenerate it from `tests/fixtures/` with:

```sh
clang -x cl -cl-std=CL1.2 --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx950 -nogpulib \
  -O2 -g0 -fno-verbose-asm -Xclang -target-feature -Xclang -xnack \
  -S copy.cl -o copy.s
```
